                            "I’m Somsak, a border patrol officer stationed at the Thailand-Myanmar border. Every day, I watch people fleeing their homes, leaving behind everything they’ve known, just to find safety. The refugees look scared, lost, and exhausted. I remember the first time I saw a mother with two young children, barely able to carry their belongings. My team and I try to do what we can to help them, but it’s never enough. The government sends food and supplies, but it’s not enough to meet the overwhelming need. Sometimes, I can’t help but feel helpless, as the refugee numbers keep rising every day. This conflict is destroying lives, and we are struggling to provide even basic shelter and care."                    `

                            "My name is Asha, and I teach at a school in Mizoram, one of India's northeastern states. Many of my students are refugees from Myanmar. I remember the first time a little child entered my class; his clothes were ragged, and his eyes were filled with terror. He didn't say much, but glanced at the ground. He'd lost everything, including his home, friends, and entire life. As a teacher, it is difficult to explain to these students why their world has been flipped upside down. But I try to make them feel welcome and give them some hope. We provide them with knowledge, a safe haven, and a sense of normalcy in the middle of their stress. It is the least I can do to help them cope.                    `

                            "I’m Zhao, a businessman based in China with investments in Myanmar. These days, I can’t help but feel a constant sense of uncertainty. The conflict has disrupted everything. My company’s operations in Myanmar are at a standstill, and we don’t know how long the situation will last. Every phone call I receive from my colleagues there is filled with uncertainty and concern for their safety. As a businessman, it’s difficult to calculate the cost of this instability. Our trade routes are interrupted, our investments are at risk, and we face increasing diplomatic pressure from both Myanmar’s military government and international organizations calling for human rights intervention. I find myself caught in the middle, trying to keep my business afloat while also considering the human cost of this ongoing conflict."

                            "I’m Amin, a volunteer in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. I work with many refugees who have fled Myanmar, mostly from the Rohingya community. Every day, I meet families who have walked miles, some barefoot, carrying nothing but the clothes on their backs. I’ll never forget the first time a group of mothers arrived at our camp with their children. They were weak, dehydrated, and frightened. Their eyes told stories of unspeakable hardship. My job is to help provide food, shelter, and medical care, but there’s never enough. The resources we have are stretched thin, and every day, more refugees arrive. The social tension is palpable – the local community, already struggling, is now faced with the burden of this refugee crisis. It’s heart-wrenching, knowing that while we try to provide some assistance, we’re only scratching the surface of a much bigger problem."                    `
